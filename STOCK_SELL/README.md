## Greedy algorithm
Greedy choice property:\
A global (overall) optimal solution can be reached by choosing the optimal choice at each step.

Optimal substructure(fundament) :\
A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solutions to the sub-problems.
